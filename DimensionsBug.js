In React Native, an uncommon error arises when using the `Dimensions` API to obtain screen dimensions within a component that hasn't fully mounted.  Accessing `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` before the component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method might return inaccurate or undefined values. This is because the layout hasn't been fully determined by the system yet.
